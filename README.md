# website
This is my personal website. I coded it from scratch using HTML, CSS and JavaScript for animations.
It also uses some PHP for the "Let's Talk!" section.

The animations I had the most fun creating was the typewritter effect for my name and the education scrolling timeline.

It is also optimized for phone screens.
